const FOUR_AXES =

export const RECALL_DESCRIPTION =
  "Recall: semantically search your second brain for relevant notes and context. "
  + "Recall when missing prior context could change the answer; otherwise reuse current context or earlier results.\n\n"
  + "EVALUATE, DON'T ASSUME. Ask for enough candidates to compare — topK 5 (the default) unless the task "
  + "justifies otherwise — then read the returned content and decide which memory actually answers the "
  + "question. Rank order and the relative score are retrieval signals, not calibrated confidence that a "
  + "memory answers you: rank 1 is a candidate, not a guarantee.\n\n"
  + "RECOVER ONCE. If the results come back empty, off-topic, ambiguous, dominated by loosely related "
  + "memories, or missing something you expected to be there, make one more targeted recall before concluding "
  + "the information is not stored. Sharpen it with any of: a more specific query, the subject named "
  + "explicitly instead of a pronoun or a vague reference, tag, kind, after, before, hops.\n\n"
  + "AS OF. When the user asks what was true at a past time (\"where did I live in March?\"), pass as_of with "
  + "that date. You get what was actually true then, with later corrections applied. A belief that was later "
  + "retracted is listed underneath, marked, and is never the answer. Without as_of, results are what is true "
  + "now: replaced facts are left out.\n\n"
  + "CHOOSE ON FIT. Prefer the memory that most directly answers the question — not automatically the newest, "
  + "the highest-scoring, the longest, or a particular kind. All else equal: semantic memories are better for "
  + "durable facts, settled decisions, preferences, and current authoritative state; episodic memories are "
  + "better for a specific event, sequence, investigation, or point-in-time question; and a specific memory "
  + "that answers the question beats a broad summary that merely discusses the same topic. Kind and lifecycle "
  + "status are separate dimensions: among otherwise comparable memories a canonical one outranks a draft for "
  + "settled or authoritative information, but not when the question is precisely about what is tentative or "
  + "still being decided.\n\n"
  + "GRAPH. Raise hops to 1-2 when the question is about why something happened, how a decision evolved, "
  + "chronology, causes, outcomes, related decisions, or what came before or after something. Leave it at 0 "
  + "when direct matches already answer the question.\n\n"
  + "EXPLAIN. Pass explain: true when the user asks why a memory came back, or when results look wrong.\n\n"
  + "TRUNCATION. Long memories come back shortened to keep the response small: any result ending in a "
  + "[truncated …] marker is PARTIAL, so call get(id) before relying on its details or quoting it. Results "
  + "without that marker are complete.\n\n"
  + `PROJECTS. ${FOUR_AXES} Call list_projects, then pass project to search inside one. `
  + "An unknown project slug is an error listing the known ones, not an empty result.";

const GET_DESCRIPTION =

  + "[truncated …] marker is partial. Call get(id) before you answer, quote, or act on such a result whenever "
  + "the omitted part could materially change the answer — a fact, a number, a decision, a sequence, exact "
  + "wording, a status change, or a later update appended to the entry. You do not have to fetch every "
  + "truncated result, only the ones you are about to rely on. Get the ID from recall or list_recent. Pass "
  + "version to read the text a memory had before one of the changes listed by history.";

const CONNECTIONS_DESCRIPTION =
  "List the memories directly linked to a given entry (its 1-hop neighbors in the relationship graph). Use it "
  + "for targeted relationship exploration once recall has already identified a relevant memory and you need "
  + "what surrounds it: causal history, decision lineage, preceding or following developments, related events, "
  + "explicit links between memories. It returns an entry's neighbors regardless of your question, so it is "
  + "not a substitute for a sharper recall query — skip it when direct recall already answers the question. "
  + "Directed relationships identify whether the requested entry is the stored source or target. Results are "
  + "paged; pass next_cursor back as cursor to continue. Get the entry ID from recall or list_recent first.";

const REMEMBER_DESCRIPTION =
  "Store a distinct, durable idea, fact, decision, task, preference, event, or reusable observation in your "
  + "second brain within the user's existing storage authorization. Save settled decisions, explicit commitments, "
  + "durable preferences and verified reusable outcomes; do not save every response or intermediate proposal. "
  + "Save an unconfirmed idea only when requested and label it as a proposal. Respect exclusions and never store "
  + "credentials. Do not ask again for each note already covered by the user's storage permission.\n\n"
  + "One memory per thing worth retrieving on its own. Before adding another memory about a subject you have "
  + "already stored, consider whether this is really an update to that memory: when it continues the same "
  + "thread — progress, a follow-up, a refinement, a later outcome — call append on the existing entry instead "
  + "of creating a near-duplicate.\n\n"
  + "VISIBILITY: on a team brain every memory lands in one of two layers. Personal = visible only to its "
  + "author. Company = visible to the whole team. If the user says \"share this\", \"the team should know\", "
  + "or similar, pass workspace: \"company\". If they say \"keep this private\", pass workspace: \"personal\". "
  + "With no workspace argument the member's configured default decides (personal unless their admin said "
  + "otherwise). Use explicit workspace: \"personal\" unless company storage is authorized. On a multi-team brain, call list_teams "
  + "first when the user wants something shared but has not named a team; pass the selected team's id as team. "
  + "recall marks each result 'shared' or "
  + "'personal', and the share tool moves an existing memory between layers at any time. "
  + "Do not create a new durable memory for a repeated no-op observation, an "
  + "unchanged status, or a restatement of something already stored.\n\n"
  + "Do store separately when the information is genuinely its own retrieval target: a distinct event, a new "
  + "decision, a reusable insight, a task, an artifact, or anything you would later want to find on its own.\n\n"
  + `PROJECTS. ${FOUR_AXES} Call list_projects to discover projects; pass project on remember when the `

  + "yet is created automatically in the workspace the memory lands in, so use the slug the user already uses "
  + "(lowercase letters, digits, - and _).\n\n"
  + "See standing, decision and owed_by/owed_to below for reminders that fire on topic, tracked decisions, "
  + "and two-way commitments.";

const APPEND_DESCRIPTION =
  "Append new information to an existing memory. The original content is preserved and your addition is "
  + "stamped with today's date, so the entry keeps its history. Get the entry ID from recall or list_recent "
  + "first.\n\n"
  + "Use append for the continuing thread of a subject already stored: evolving project or task state, a "
  + "follow-up event, a later outcome attached to the original subject, a decision being refined, an ongoing "
  + "investigation, or recurring monitoring where something meaningfully changed. Prefer append over remember "
  + "whenever a new memory would substantially duplicate an existing continuing one.\n\n"
  + "Do not append unrelated information merely to avoid creating a new entry — if it is its own retrieval "
  + "target, call remember. To replace content that is simply no longer correct, use update.\n\n"
  + "After a successful append, inspect the rollover notice. If rollover is recommended or required, create a "
  + "concise current-state snapshot and call rollover before the next append. The old journal remains intact.";

const UPDATE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Replace the full content of an existing memory. Use it when the prior content is no longer the correct "
  + "representation — a preference reversed, a decision overturned, a fact superseded. It is not the mechanism "
  + "for incremental history: use append when the earlier content still stands and you are adding to it. Get "
  + "the entry ID from recall or list_recent first. Every successful replacement preserves the prior version; "
  + "use history on the current entry ID to inspect it.";

const LIST_RECENT_DESCRIPTION =
  "list_recent: List the most recent entries by date from your second brain. Use it to browse recent activity "
  + "or to locate an entry by time. It returns entries by recency, not by semantic relevance — when you want "
  + "memories that match a meaning, use recall. Long entries are shortened: a result ending in a [truncated …] "
  + "marker is PARTIAL, so call get(id) for its full text. "
  + "Pass actor to list only what one person wrote — their name as shown in the header, their user id, or \"me\". "
  + "Pass team (id from list_teams) with workspace:\"company\" to browse one team's shared layer. "
  + "Pass project (slug from list_projects) to browse one project; an unknown slug is an error, not an empty list. "
  + "Pass in_trash: true to list memories in the trash (forgotten recently and not yet removed for good), for "

const LIST_TEAMS_DESCRIPTION =

  + "to narrow to one layer.";

const SHARE_DESCRIPTION =
